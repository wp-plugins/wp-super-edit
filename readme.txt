== Installation ==

1. Take the whole whole “wp-super-edit” folder and put it in the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your Web site. How it gets there is up to you (FTP, WebDAV, RSYNC, SCP.. choose your poison!)
2. Activate the plugin on the Wordpress Plugins administration panel
3. Click on the Settings option and you will see WP Super Edit in the sub menu.
4. WP Super Edit should lead you through the final installation steps. Please be patient! WP Super Edit will attempt to save original settings while installing. WP Super Edit will not work until the installation has been completed!

**Upgrade**

**Versions 1.5 or earlier:**

Before you install WP Super Edit, you should deactivate the old version of WP Super Edit and remove the superedit folder from the wp-content/plugins folder of your WordPress installation. Follow the installation instructions for the updated version. The updated version should use the wp-super-edit folder in wp-content/plugins and be more compatible and easier to update in the future. Due to the changes in the WordPress editor your old settings will not be updated for the new version of WP Super Edit.
